1. space for unit cards (for now we'll leave blank, we aren't there yet)
2. health bar
3. weapon indicator icon
4. 



for rotation, make it such that selected units, when rotation cursor selected, will rotate as follows:
CLOSEST unit to the mouse will rotate in direction of mouse when right-clicked. visible line between unit and cursor (which will change during this). All other units are rotated to that same rotation, regardless of current angle to mouse position.

for selecting units, try this:
while left-click, any unit that detects mouse is selected.



func NPC_control():
	print(leader.rotation)
	var destination_dir = (get_global_mouse_position() - leader.global_position).normalized()
	print(leader.rotation_speed)
	leader.rotation = destination_dir.angle()*leader.rotation_speed
	leader.velocity = Vector2(leader.linear_speed, 0).rotated(leader.rotation)
